# FIXME
#
# * properties.readOnly
#   (FIXED) * readOnly: true has no effect
# * properties.writeOnly
#   (FIXED - using both JSONSchema and UISchema here - reuses password browser field)* to be discussed
# * properties.hidden
#   (FIXED) * hidden: true has no effect
# * properties.constValue
#   * doesn't work as expected, it displays combo box - waiting on rjsf fix then will emit `const` here

properties:
  - placeholder:
      type: string
      placeholder: Type your name
      description: >-
        You should see a placeholder in the textfield.
  - constValue:
      type: string
      const: Cyryl
      description: >-
        Fixed value.
  - defaultValue:
      type: string
      default: Cyryl
      description: >-
        It should be by default filled with `Cyryl`.
  - readOnly:
      type: string
      default: Cyryl
      readOnly: true
      description: >-
        Must not be editable, but visible.
  - writeOnly:
      type: string
      default: Cyryl
      writeOnly: true
      description: >-
        Whenever you receive value in dry JSON, it must be cleared and
        it must not be displayed to the user.

        Not sure if this should be handled on the reconfix side, probably yes.
  - hidden:
      type: string
      hidden: true
      description: >-
        This works as a normal property, but it's hidden from the UI. It can be
        used as a computation property for example.
