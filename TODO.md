* migrate to balenaCI - needs a new repo type
* add all components that will create the full layout first, without necessarily having library calls to provide functionality
* use some proper editor component instead of the yaml textarea - needed to disable `tab` press right now - would be ideal to have a full editor there maybe, supporting indentation etc ?
* find out what would it take to stabilize rendition's `form`
* make the dry json field update automatically as user types into the form - delete `submit` button
