* migrate to balenaCI - needs a new repo type
* use some proper editor component instead of the yaml textarea - needed to disable `tab` press right now - would be ideal to have a full editor there maybe, supporting indentation etc ?
* optimize - right now everything is built and deployed in development mode, resulting in ~12MB page :D
* typescript support -> enable extracting typescript rendition subcomponents
* find out what would it take to stabilize rendition's `form`
* make th dry json field update automatically as user types into the form - delete `submit` button
* think through layout - try fitting everything on one screen
